This script builds a self-contained Music Player Daemon (MPD) package.

To show this help, run ./build.sh --help

Build usage: 
./build.sh --target=ARCH --prefix=PREFIX --output=FILENAME -jLEVEL

Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.

Build options:
  --target=ARCH           architecture of the target system [armv7]
  --prefix=PREFIX         the path to MPD on the target system
                          [/opt/mpd-<version>_<yyyymmdd>]
  --output=FILENAME       filename of the output package
                          (should end with '.tar.gz')
                          [mpd-<version>.<ARCH>-<yyyymmdd>-<build_id>.tar.gz]
  -jLEVEL                 set the make concurrency level to LEVEL [1]

Other usage:
./build.sh [clean or distclean] --target=ARCH

Clean options:
  clean                   clear files and directories created during build
  distclean               same as clean, but also clear downloaded package
                          sources
  --target=ARCH           if this option is specified, then clean or distclean 
                          will only clear build files and directories related
                          to ARCH
